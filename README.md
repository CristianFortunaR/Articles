# ✍️ Articles Repository

Hey there! 👋  
Welcome to my **Articles** repository — a space where I keep my written work, ideas, and thoughts in Markdown files.  
Think of it as a digital notebook for everything I create and explore.

## 🧠 What You’ll Find Here

I write about things that connect **science, technology, and creativity**.  
Expect articles and drafts around:

- ⚛️ Physics, chaos, and quantum computation  
- 💻 Software development and AI  
- 🛰️ Space technology and cybersecurity  
- 🎮 Game design, simulation, and storytelling  

Some pieces are polished, others are just raw thoughts — but all are part of my journey as a creator and researcher.
