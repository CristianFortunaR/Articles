### Technical Essays & Deep Tech Explorations by Cristian Fortuna

Welcome to my personal repository of technical articles and essays.  
Here I store my writings in Markdown format — covering topics across **Physics**, **Quantum Technologies**, **Cybersecurity**, and **Deep Tech Systems**.

Each piece is both a standalone post and part of a broader journey to merge **scientific insight** with **computational reasoning** — from theoretical physics to real-world implementation.

### **How Quantum Communication Can Revolutionize Global Connectivity**  
**Published on Substack → [Read it here](https://open.substack.com/pub/cristianfortuna/p/how-quantum-communication-can-revolutionize?r=1wm59b&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true)**  

Quantum communication marks a paradigm shift in how we establish and secure global connections.  
By leveraging the laws of quantum mechanics, it transcends the limitations of classical information transfer and lays the foundation for the **quantum internet** — where *security is guaranteed by physics itself.*

> “Quantum-secured links aren’t just stronger — they’re unbreakable.”
